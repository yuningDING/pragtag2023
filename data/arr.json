", "Then, they annotated the collected sentences with semantic role labels using a frame-free methodology (which eliminates the need to instruct the annotators about an ontology, e.g., PropBank or FrameNet), trained a system on the source domain and evaluated the resulting system on the out-of-domain test sets.\n", "The main takeaway is that, indeed, even though the system achieves very good results on the test set of the source domain, there is a significant drop in performance on the target domains.
